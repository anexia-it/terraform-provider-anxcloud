  This resource allows you to create DNS records for a specified zone. TXT records might behave funny, we are working on it. Create and delete operations will be handled in batches internally. As a side effect this will cause whole batches to fail in case some of the operations are invalid. Updating record attributes triggers a replacement (destroy old -> create new).

# anxcloud_dns_record (Resource)

This resource allows you to create DNS records for a specified zone. TXT records might behave funny, we are working on it. Create and delete operations will be handled in batches internally. As a side effect this will cause whole batches to fail in case some of the operations are invalid. Updating record attributes triggers a replacement (destroy old -> create new).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "anxcloud_dns_record" "example" {
  name      = "webmail"
  zone_name = "example.com"
  type      = "A"
  rdata     = "198.51.100.10"
  ttl       = 3600
}
```
